          There will be a total of 3 rounds. At the end of each successive
          round, the robot will be awarded points or penalties based on their

              1) Round one will consist of a series of line(s) that the robot
              will have to navigate through to get from the starting block to
              the goal/end block. The time taken by the robot to complete this
              round will be the criteria on which points will be awarded.

          2) Round two will consist of a series of line(s) (resembling a maze)
          that the robot will have to successfully navigate through without
          crashing into the obstacle/wall placed. Failing to do so will result
          in penalties or elimination based on the decision of the judges. The
          time taken by the robot to complete this round will be the criteria on
          which points/penalties will be awarded. There will be three (3) test
          runs and three (3) attempts for this round. The smallest of the 3
          recorded time during the three (3) attempts will be considered.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3 text-lg md:text-2xl text-white">
          3) Round three will consist of a series of line(s) arranged in loops
          that the robot will successfully have to navigate through without
          entering into and staying in a loop. In case a robot does get stuck in
          a loop, the participant will be allowed to manually pick up the robot
          and place it at a designated way point/spot. However, a time penalty
          of 20% of the total run time will be awarded. The time taken by the
          robot to complete this round will be the criteria on which
          points/penalties will be awarded. If the robot is unable to
          successfully navigate through the round, penalties or elimination
          based on the decision of the judges will be awarded. There will be
          three (3) test runs and three (3) attempts for this round. The
          smallest of the 3 recorded time during the three (3) attempts will be
          considered.
